// VR display frame region + viewport classifier (Hydra's g_final_screen_region /
// SetViewportType, adapted to the OpenXR architecture).
//
// The authoritative "displayed frame" is the EFB->XFB copy source rectangle — the region
// of the EFB that is actually scanned out to the TV. A full-width EFB *clear* is NOT a
// reliable source: many games clear more lines than they display (Mario Galaxy), while
// Metroid Prime Trilogy really does display 480 lines but renders the scene into 448.
//
// Everything here runs on the video thread only (FIFO order), so plain statics are safe.
